17:26:16	>> Thank you for the
17:26:18	introduction.  Thank you so much
17:26:19	for having me at this
17:26:20	conference.  It's been so
17:26:22	awesome.  And I am intimidated
17:26:26	as hell to be talking in front
17:26:27	of all of you brilliant people.
17:26:29	This is actually the first time
17:26:31	I've ever spoken at a conference
17:26:32	too.
17:26:33	So thanks for having me.  Last
17:26:35	talk!
17:26:39	All right.  So right.  Designing
17:26:45	Virtual Reality Visualizations.
17:26:46	What's VR?  Cool.  Some people
17:26:48	know, some don't, some people
17:26:50	have some big ideas.  Here's a
17:26:51	2D line chart, a 3D line chart.
17:26:55	Here is VR or what you would see
17:26:58	if you were wearing a VR
17:27:01	headset.  So it's 3D in
17:27:03	stereoscopic, you get a
17:27:07	different image in each eye and
17:27:09	an added dimension to play with,
17:27:12	time, or motion if you choose to
17:27:14	use it.  And you have a thing on
17:27:15	your head that looks like maybe
17:27:17	one of these things.  Oculus or
17:27:21	Google Cardboard.  Or -- there's
17:27:25	a lot of them coming out now.
17:27:27	If you don't have a Google
17:27:29	Cardboard, you can go get it.  I
17:27:32	would really suggest it.  It's
17:27:34	easy to get.
17:27:35	I just looked it up before this
17:27:37	talk, it's $5.  That's like dot
17:27:44	come, something.  If you have 5
17:27:47	bucks, I would highly recommend
17:27:49	getting the Google Cardboard.
17:27:54	All right.  So why is everyone
17:27:56	so into VR?  What's the big
17:27:58	deal?  It hacks your brain, it's
17:28:00	really nuts.  If you haven't
17:28:01	tried it before, try it out.
17:28:04	Your mind is tricked into
17:28:05	believing that you are present
17:28:07	in the world that's rendered in
17:28:09	VR.  Not necessarily not in the
17:28:11	world that you're currently in,
17:28:13	but you really just get the
17:28:15	sense, like if here's just a
17:28:18	couple of images that are
17:28:19	examples.  Like this is one
17:28:20	where you put your arms out in
17:28:21	front of you, and you have this
17:28:23	thing on your head, and there's
17:28:25	a spider on the table.  And then
17:28:26	it really like feels like that
17:28:28	spider is about to crawl on your
17:28:29	arm.  You get chills up your
17:28:31	arm.  It's crazy.
17:28:32	This is a visualization someone
17:28:35	made of the walk on a tight rope
17:28:38	between the twin towers.  And
17:28:39	you look down, and you're like,
17:28:41	oh, man.  That really feels
17:28:44	scary.
17:28:46	So it hacks your brain in a way
17:28:49	that I've never experienced
17:28:51	before.  It really creates a
17:28:53	depth of emotion that I think
17:28:55	people are really excited about.
17:28:57	Cool.  So there's two kinds of
17:28:59	VR content being made right now.
17:29:01	And there's AR, which is
17:29:04	augmented reality, which is a
17:29:06	whole other ball game, I'm not
17:29:07	going to get into, but right now
17:29:09	the two kinds of VR content are
17:29:13	360-degree video and rendered 3D
17:29:16	graphics.  So 360-degree video,
17:29:20	there's been a lot of journalism
17:29:23	done.  And I come from a
17:29:24	journalism background.  So I'm
17:29:26	going to be sort of focus on
17:29:31	journalistic applications.
17:29:32	Harvest of change was one of the
17:29:34	first ground breaking ones.
17:29:36	This placed an amazing piece by
17:29:39	New York.  Times magazine.  The
17:29:42	Wall Street Journal put out a
17:29:45	cool piece following a ballerina
17:29:48	behind the scenes at Lincoln
17:29:49	Center.  All of these are really
17:29:51	rad.  And then there's 3D
17:29:53	rendered.  How do you make it
17:29:55	happen?
17:29:55	For the 360 video, you need a
17:29:58	whole crap ton of GoPros or new
17:30:03	fancy 360-degree cameras.  And
17:30:06	the render stuff, 3D rendering
17:30:09	software, people use unity.  And
17:30:12	three.js, and it's open source,
17:30:17	it's JavaScript.  It's a new
17:30:22	medium.
17:30:23	In 2012 Nonny de la Pena debuted
17:30:30	hunger in Los Angeles.  The
17:30:32	Google Cardboard only came out
17:30:35	in July of 2014.  And now it's
17:30:38	now.  It really hasn't been that
17:30:40	long since July 2014.  That was
17:30:43	really the turning point in
17:30:44	accessibility for VR content.
17:30:47	Like if you make something now
17:30:49	people can actually see it.  So
17:30:51	it really hasn't been that long
17:30:53	since it happened.
17:30:56	So this is a datavis conference,
17:31:02	right?  There's been a lot of VR
17:31:06	journalism that's 360-based.
17:31:09	It's really cool.  But I want to
17:31:11	see more of taking advantage of
17:31:12	the experience of the VR to tell
17:31:15	data-driven stories.  That
17:31:17	sounds hard.  Someone that has
17:31:18	been doing this is this guy,
17:31:20	Brian, works at POV.  Or had
17:31:23	worked at POV.  Now has his own
17:31:26	company.  Dataviz.  Can I make
17:31:31	this video thing happen?  No.
17:31:35	>> It was working.
17:31:38	>> Oh.  Sick.  Try it again.
17:31:39	All right, cool.  So I'll let
17:31:41	this play through.  He created
17:31:43	this visualization and you're
17:31:45	walking through a city.  This is
17:31:48	census data, I think.  And this
17:31:51	goes for a while.  And then the
17:31:52	next part of this video that you
17:31:55	see -- I don't know if keynote
17:31:58	will let me fast forward, so I'm
17:32:01	going to just keep talking.  The
17:32:03	next part of this video you'll
17:32:04	see is -- here we go.  Crime
17:32:07	rates.  So the areas in red have
17:32:09	a higher crime rate than the
17:32:11	surrounding area.  And that, I
17:32:13	think, really takes advantage of
17:32:15	your sort of visceral experience
17:32:17	moving through this space.  It's
17:32:20	primal.  We understand that red
17:32:23	is bad or danger or poison,
17:32:26	don't eat that frog or whatever.
17:32:29	So as you're walking through it,
17:32:31	going through it, you're going
17:32:33	through a red zone, you really
17:32:34	feel it's dangerous.  So I think
17:32:37	that's a really successful use
17:32:38	of it.
17:32:39	So here at the Wall Street
17:32:42	Journal -- not here, in New
17:32:45	York.  We made this thing, VR
17:32:47	NASDAQ, that was pegged to when
17:32:50	the NASDAQ broke its previous
17:32:53	record, its previous high from
17:32:55	the year 2000.  Which was just
17:32:57	about one year ago.  Almost one
17:32:59	year exactly ago.  And I'll show
17:33:02	you a demo of that.
17:33:04	We made it in web GL.  So I'm
17:33:08	not going to show the
17:33:09	stereoscopic version, you can do
17:33:12	that in your Google Cardboards
17:33:15	that I'm assuming you're all
17:33:16	going to get from Sears.com for
17:33:19	$5 and look at it that way.  But
17:33:22	right now I'm going to show it
17:33:23	to you in the sort of 3D mode.
17:33:26	In IMAX.
17:33:32	So you start pre-2000 boom.  You
17:33:38	can see sort of elements going
17:33:40	by on the left-hand side.  Like
17:33:43	a timeline.  And the path that
17:33:45	you're walking on is mapped to
17:33:47	the inverse of the price to
17:33:49	earnings ratio.  So as you are
17:33:52	approaching the top, that path
17:33:54	is getting really, really
17:33:56	skinny.  And you can look down
17:33:58	and see, man, that is a skinny
17:34:00	path.  That is dangerous.
17:34:03	And that happened really fast.
17:34:05	It this is really steep.  And
17:34:07	we're about to go down.  And
17:34:09	here we go.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh,
17:34:13	no.
17:34:17	I've never had to narrate this
17:34:19	in realtime before.  Utilize the
17:34:21	sort of color understanding as
17:34:24	well with the areas of red being
17:34:27	times of recession.  So now
17:34:30	we'll just sort of climb slowly
17:34:32	back to the present day.  Or one
17:34:35	year ago when the NASDAQ broke
17:34:38	its previous high.  And as
17:34:40	you're sort of coming back up,
17:34:42	you really get the sense that
17:34:45	like it's a pretty steady climb.
17:34:46	That path that you're walking on
17:34:48	is nice and wide.  Looks pretty
17:34:51	stable.  It feels very different
17:34:55	than it felt when you were at
17:34:58	the part of the visualization
17:35:00	from the year 2000 in that giant
17:35:02	bubble.
17:35:04	And that feeling, that different
17:35:06	feeling was -- I think we
17:35:09	utilize that to communicate --
17:35:15	yeah, to communicate all those
17:35:16	numbers were the same.  The
17:35:18	price of the NASDAQ index was
17:35:21	the same.  Oh, and there's the
17:35:23	rocket mode -- the price was the
17:35:25	same, but the feeling is
17:35:27	different.  And that's it.  Plus
17:35:29	rocket ships, because -- why
17:35:33	not?
17:35:34	Cool.  So like I said, we use D3
17:35:38	and open js.  Open source
17:35:41	libraries.  And my partner in
17:35:44	creating this interactive, Roger
17:35:47	Kenny, is the man.  I was
17:35:48	involved in the conceptual and
17:35:50	design.  And our art director
17:35:54	was very involved in art
17:35:55	direction.  The majority of the
17:35:57	code base was written by Roger
17:35:58	and he rules.  And you can rule
17:36:00	too.  Because he wrote a
17:36:01	tutorial, a brief tutorial for a
17:36:05	setup.  And you can find here.
17:36:06	And I have a resources slide at
17:36:08	the end that I'll just leave up.
17:36:10	And happy to share with whoever.
17:36:12	It's actually pretty easy.
17:36:14	There's a lot of open source
17:36:15	tools to making sort of basic VR
17:36:18	environments.
17:36:20	Yeah.  Depending on time I was
17:36:23	going to do a demo of that.
17:36:25	Yeah, maybe after.  After.
17:36:26	Okay.  So why do we do it?  I
17:36:29	already talked about that part.
17:36:31	Why do we do it in the browser?
17:36:33	So anybody can look at it.  In
17:36:36	the Google Card boards you are
17:36:40	getting for $5.  A third party
17:36:44	player for 360 degree video, and
17:36:49	wouldn't need to do stitching
17:36:51	for the GoPros.  It's a huge
17:36:53	video file and really tedious.
17:36:56	So browser-based, 3js, VR.
17:37:01	Awesome.
17:37:03	Some challenges.  Kind of a lot
17:37:04	of challenges.  I'll start with
17:37:08	user intersection.  How do you
17:37:11	design an interface when your
17:37:13	user has no hands?  Like over
17:37:18	here, the hands are over here
17:37:21	holding the thing on their head.
17:37:23	How are you supposed to navigate
17:37:25	an interface like that?  There
17:37:28	are really two inputs that we
17:37:30	can take advantage of, the focal
17:37:32	point in the very center.  And
17:37:33	there's like one button on the
17:37:35	side of most headsets.  So we
17:37:39	use that to do like stop and go.
17:37:41	And the focal point to kind of
17:37:43	look at a button.
17:37:44	But, of course, you can't just
17:37:46	have people pressing buttons
17:37:47	willy nilly, whatever they look
17:37:49	at, so we had sort of a
17:37:52	countdown.  We had this
17:37:53	stoplight metaphor of like red,
17:37:56	yellow, green.  And Google in a
17:37:58	lot of stuff they make, they
17:37:59	have a concentric circle thing
17:38:01	that grows and lets you know
17:38:03	that you have selected a button.
17:38:06	Or action item.
17:38:10	There might be more
17:38:12	possibilities that open up when
17:38:13	people start using controllers
17:38:15	in conjunction with headsets.
17:38:17	But right now I work at Wall
17:38:20	Street Journal, I'm thinking
17:38:23	about making stuff that's kind
17:38:25	of as accessible as possible to
17:38:26	the most number of people.
17:38:28	So I'm not thinking about the
17:38:30	problem too much of how to make
17:38:32	the most complicated, intricate
17:38:37	to navigate visualization
17:38:39	interactive in VR.  Because it's
17:38:43	not -- it's not my problem to
17:38:45	solve right now.  But maybe it's
17:38:46	yours.  That sounded so corny.
17:38:51	First talk ever.  There we go.
17:38:58	Information density has to be
17:38:59	kind of low because it's hard to
17:39:01	read in VR.  And that's the real
17:39:04	thing.  Like the paragraphs we
17:39:06	had on those sort of bulletin
17:39:08	things were kind of about as
17:39:10	much as we could get in there.
17:39:12	And there was a timeline
17:39:13	element, but it was hard to
17:39:15	focus on all the stuff going by.
17:39:17	It's hard to read text in VR.
17:39:20	Eyestrain and nausea are real
17:39:23	things.  And in the VR at
17:39:29	NASDAQ, we kind of had to find
17:39:31	this balance -- we had weekly
17:39:33	data of the NASDAQ, but we
17:39:36	didn't want the camera to bounce
17:39:39	along each of those data points,
17:39:41	because then you get really
17:39:43	nauseous.  So we had to find
17:39:44	something in between, like
17:39:46	staying accurate to the data and
17:39:47	making something that wouldn't
17:39:49	make people feel sick.  So Roger
17:39:53	worked hard on this algorithm
17:39:54	that sort of followed the curve
17:39:56	of it without being too bumpy.
17:39:59	But I'm still not sure if we got
17:40:02	that quite right or not.  And it
17:40:03	was difficult.
17:40:04	There's also a perception
17:40:06	difficulties with 3D charts.  As
17:40:09	Kennedy mentioned, I definitely
17:40:12	made this slide today.  We're
17:40:13	not that good at reading 3D
17:40:17	charts.  So it might not be an
17:40:21	ideal medium for a lot of data
17:40:24	visualizations.  And
17:40:25	gimmickiness, people are going
17:40:27	to yell at you on Twitter if you
17:40:29	make some VR chart thing just
17:40:31	for the sake of making a VR
17:40:33	chart thing and then put it out
17:40:34	there.  People are going to be
17:40:35	like, why did you do that?  And
17:40:44	then you're going to be like,
17:40:45	stop.  I'm sad.  Don't make fun
17:40:48	of me.
17:40:49	I'm like in second grade in my
17:40:52	head.  Yeah.  People don't
17:40:56	generally have the cardboards
17:41:01	yet either.  That's a thing.  Or
17:41:02	they don't have headsets yet.
17:41:04	So like designing for cardboard,
17:41:06	designing for the sort of lowest
17:41:09	VR denominator is the thing.
17:41:12	And having a fallback, which you
17:41:14	can just look at in the browser
17:41:16	if you go to/3D NASDAQ, that's
17:41:22	what you see in your browser.
17:41:26	WSJ/3D NASDAQ.  And
17:41:31	One more thing, I'm going to
17:41:33	show you a flowchart.  Ready?
17:41:37	This was a giant pain in the
17:41:39	butt.
17:41:41	Yeah.  So VR chart versus line
17:41:46	chart.  You get a third
17:41:48	dimension, a time dimension, the
17:41:50	magic brain hacking feeling.
17:41:51	But you lose interactions, lose
17:41:55	ease of navigation,
17:41:57	accessibility, legibility, lose
17:41:59	perceptional accuracy and have a
17:42:02	heightened risk of people making
17:42:04	fun of you on Twitter.  So what
17:42:05	is it good for?  Like why do
17:42:08	that?  Because that seems like a
17:42:10	whole lot of bad things.
17:42:13	It's good for potentially
17:42:15	multidimensional data that you
17:42:18	wouldn't be able to explore
17:42:19	otherwise.  And it's good for
17:42:21	using people's feelings about
17:42:23	space to communicate stuff about
17:42:25	data sets.  What does that mean?
17:42:28	But how?
17:42:30	I don't know is the answer.
17:42:32	Here are some things that I
17:42:33	thought of that people have
17:42:35	feelings about that have to do
17:42:36	with space.  Fear of heights.
17:42:39	It's hard to walk on small
17:42:40	things.  Red maybe means danger.
17:42:43	Moving quickly feels different
17:42:45	than moving slowly.  Flying is
17:42:47	cool, point pointy things might
17:42:50	hurt, large things might be
17:42:51	heavy.  Et cetera, et cetera.
17:42:53	Why use this to visualize data?
17:42:58	I don't know.  We made it at
17:43:00	NASDAQ a year ago.  And I
17:43:01	haven't thought of another great
17:43:03	reason to do it again yet.
17:43:04	Which is why I haven't.  So you
17:43:10	guys think of something.
17:43:13	And then tell me before you tell
17:43:17	anyone else about it.  Is VR a
17:43:22	fad?  Is something people are
17:43:24	thinking.  But I think hell nah.
17:43:26	Or at least I've had the Kool
17:43:32	aid.  One of the reasons, kids
17:43:35	dig it.  Kids really like VR.
17:43:36	And in ten years people who are
17:43:38	kids now are going to be like
17:43:40	the main consumer of tech
17:43:41	content.  So kids dig it.  So we
17:43:45	all kind of got to get on board,
17:43:47	I think.  So now is the part
17:43:48	where I show you some of the
17:43:50	coolest shit I have ever seen.
17:43:54	Ready?  Maybe it's easier to do
17:43:58	this in the browser.  How do I
17:44:01	do that?  Let's see.  Coolest
17:44:08	shit I've ever seen time.
17:44:12	Is that working?  Sweet.  This
17:44:16	is called the machine to be
17:44:19	another.  So these two people
17:44:21	are wearing that and they are
17:44:23	seeing the other person's body
17:44:26	in their eyeballs.  And that is
17:44:29	crazy.  People talk a lot about
17:44:32	empathy and empathy being like
17:44:34	the most important thing for
17:44:36	journalism right now.  Or being
17:44:38	able to harvest empathy, make
17:44:41	people feel something.  Make
17:44:43	people understand the point of
17:44:45	view of another person in a
17:44:47	world of another group of
17:44:49	people.  That's why we tell
17:44:51	stories, right?  That's kind of
17:44:52	it.
17:44:52	So I think this is an incredible
17:44:55	tool.  Just an incredible tool
17:44:57	to be able to do that.  I'm so
17:44:59	stoked.  You can tell.  I'm
17:45:01	sure.
17:45:03	This is tilt brush.  Which is
17:45:08	the HTC vibe.  Which I haven't
17:45:10	gotten to try yet.  But I'm
17:45:12	looking forward to it home boy
17:45:13	is drawing in 3D.  And that is
17:45:15	nuts.  And then you can go like
17:45:18	walk in the middle of the
17:45:19	drawing.  That's crazy.  That's
17:45:21	some of the coolest shit seen.
17:45:24	This is Oculus toy box.  That
17:45:27	guy is like playing with another
17:45:32	human being who's not in the
17:45:33	physical space he's in, but is
17:45:35	in the virtual space he's in.
17:45:37	And they're waving at each
17:45:39	other.  See?  Thumbs up, cool.
17:45:41	That is some of the coolest shit
17:45:44	I have ever seen.  Right?  I
17:45:46	mean, man.  This is a Tribeca
17:45:53	film institute interactive
17:45:56	Website.  And they have a lot
17:45:58	more really awesome stuff.  So
17:46:00	that is a really good resource
17:46:01	for checking out more of the
17:46:03	coolest shit you have ever seen
17:46:06	in your life.
17:46:07	I think I might be ready to go
17:46:08	back.  And we're back.  Oh.  I'm
17:46:14	done.  Cool.  Thank you.
